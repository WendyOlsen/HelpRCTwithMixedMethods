# HelpRCTwithMixedMethods
Help for Randomised Control Trials in Social Contexts, with Mixed Methods (2025)
Welcome! 
Your journey into randomised control trials, or social interventions or both, has started!
As an expert in sampling and statistics, I am happy to help with your queries in this area. To start you off, notice some details in Kim (et al., 2023) baseline study which is free and public online. We list that below as our highlight study.  Here you see the in-situ issues of stakeholders who are in the focus groups, how to conduct a local multi-stage random sampling process, gender of interviewers, and the clarification of the intervention over time.

We will update the site with final results after Phase 2 is written up.

The usual process is:

  |-| 
  |-| Plan the Treatment
  |-| Plan the Samples (Include a Control Group)
  |-| Get Funding
  |-| Start Phase 1 with Stakeholder Engagement 
  |-| Phase 1 Survey as a Baseline Survey
  |-|       + Focus groups, interviews and other action research
  |-|       Conduct the treatment(s) on the treatment group(s)
  |-| Start Phase 2 
  |-|       + Again, focus groups, interviews, and/or other action research
  |-|       Conduct the second survey as a followup survey
  |-| Code all the data - both qualitative and quantitative
  |-| Analyse the two phases of survey data usin Difference in Difference modelling.
  |-|       + A simpler approach to this is using interaction effects
  |-|       (Time*Group) in the regression model.
  |-| Discuss results with the stakeholders
  |-| Write up the results
  |-|
